# UFC Fights Reminder

## App Goal
The problem with watching UFC from a country other than America is the time difference. Viewers sometimes just want to watch only one fight which will be at night. Users don't know exactly when their chosen fight will occur because the duration of fights sometimes varies. This app solves this problem by waking up the viewer at the exact time for their chosen fight. It does this by downloading data about the end of the fight before the chosen fight, and then wakes up the user.

## Actions
This is a Flutter project. The app downloads fighters' data by scraping data using HTTP requests and also uses an external fight scores API. Project was started but never completed due to other projects.
